Huffman File Encoder

Work In Progress

This is a program that encodes binary data of a file using Huffman encoding. It also provides a decoder.

Current State: 
- The encoder is working for input symbols of 1 byte.
- The decoder is working for files created with the encoder (but it's quite slow decoding).

TODO:
- Increace efficiency (specially the decoder)
- Clean code
- Delete commented code
- Comment code
