Huffman File Encoder

Work In Progress

This is a program that encodes binary data of a file using Huffman encoding. It also provides a decoder.

Current State: 
- The encoder is working for input symbols of 1 byte.
- The decoder is partially working (The encoder adds trash at the end of the file, so the decoder decodes the trash, ending with a larger file)

TODO:
- Encode files without trash
- Clean code
- Delete commented code
- Comment code
